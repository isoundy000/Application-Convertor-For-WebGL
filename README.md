# Application-Convertor-For-WebGL*
A tool for converting WebGL to OpenGL ES2.0 application

WebGL is useful for web developers to create fancy 3D application and games. But there are rare tools to analyze WebGL performance. This project will provide a tool for developers to convert WebGL application to native OpenGL ES2.0 application, and the native application can be deployed to Android, Linux, and ChromeOS. With the native application, we can analyze the performance, compare its performance with the WebGL one, and we can utilize bunch of tools for OpenGL ES2.0 application, to help us debug, analyze the issues.

# How to use
Please follow the user guide in UserGuide folder to setup the environment and convert the WebGL application
